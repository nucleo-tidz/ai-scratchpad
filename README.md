# Introduction

this project demonstrates the use of Azure OpenAI, Azure Cognitive services, and Semantic Kernel to create interactive application

## Use Case: Troubleshooting Guide


In this use case, a company prdouecs mobile phones. Users often face common issues that can be resolved by following specific troubleshooting steps. Instead of sifting through lengthy documentation, users can now ask specific questions through a chat interface.

> **Example Questions**
- "How do I fix batery issue?"
- "Why my bluetooth is not working ?"


> **Key Technologies**
- Azure OpenAI: Provides natural language understanding and generation to interpret user queries and generate human-like responses.
- Azure Cognitive Search: Indexes and retrieves relevant information from the data stored in Blob Storage based on user queries.
- Semantic Kernel: Enhances the interaction by understanding the context and maintaining conversational state, ensuring coherent and relevant responses.

> **Architecture**

- User Query: A user asks a question via a chat interface.
- Azure OpenAI: The query is processed and interpreted.
- Azure Cognitive Search: Relevant data from the Blob Storage file is retrieved.
- Semantic Kernel: The response is generated by combining search results and the context of the conversation.
- Response Delivery: The user receives a contextual and accurate answer.
